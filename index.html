					## What is a Tamagotchi

					A Tamagotchi is a small, handheld digital pet that you can feed, play with, put to bed and clean up after. Look after it well by feeding it the right kinds of foods, showering it with attention and cleaning up after it when required, and your Tamagotchi will grow up to be a smart, well-respected member of society. Ignore its needs and its mood will sour until it eventually dies.
